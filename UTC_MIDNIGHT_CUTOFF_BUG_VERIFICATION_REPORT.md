# UTC Midnight Cutoff Bug Verification Report

**Date**: August 13, 2025  
**Platform**: Intellego Platform  
**Issue**: UTC Midnight Cutoff Bug in Week Assignment  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED AND VERIFIED**

---

## Executive Summary

The UTC midnight cutoff bug has been successfully identified, corrected, and thoroughly tested. The issue was in the `getCurrentWeekStart()` and `getCurrentWeekEnd()` functions in `/src/lib/db-operations.ts`, which were using the server's local timezone instead of Argentina timezone for week boundary calculations.

**Result**: All new submissions will now correctly use Argentina timezone boundaries, preventing Sunday night submissions from being assigned to the wrong week.

---

## Bug Analysis

### Root Cause
The original week calculation functions used JavaScript's `new Date()` constructor with local system methods, which resulted in week boundaries being calculated based on the server's timezone rather than Argentina's timezone (UTC-3).

### Impact
- Sunday night submissions (e.g., 23:30 ART) were being assigned to the following week instead of the current week
- 50 historical reports were affected by this bug and have been corrected separately
- Students' weekly progress tracking was inconsistent

### Critical Scenarios
1. **Sunday 23:30 ART**: Should be assigned to week ending that Sunday
2. **Monday 00:30 ART**: Should be assigned to new week starting that Monday
3. **Week boundary transitions**: Must respect Argentina timezone boundaries

---

## Solution Implemented

### Code Changes

**File**: `/src/lib/db-operations.ts`  
**Lines**: 270-304

#### Before (Buggy Implementation):
```typescript
export function getCurrentWeekStart(): Date {
  const now = new Date();
  const monday = new Date(now);
  const day = now.getDay();
  const diff = now.getDate() - day + (day === 0 ? -6 : 1);
  monday.setDate(diff);
  monday.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  return monday;
}
```

#### After (Fixed Implementation):
```typescript
export function getCurrentWeekStart(): Date {
  // Get current UTC time
  const nowUTC = new Date();
  
  // Convert to Argentina timezone (UTC-3)
  const argentinaOffset = -3 * 60; // Argentina is UTC-3 (in minutes)
  const argentinaTime = new Date(nowUTC.getTime() + (argentinaOffset * 60 * 1000));
  
  // Calculate Monday of current week in Argentina timezone
  const day = argentinaTime.getUTCDay();
  const diff = argentinaTime.getUTCDate() - day + (day === 0 ? -6 : 1);
  
  const monday = new Date(argentinaTime);
  monday.setUTCDate(diff);
  monday.setUTCHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  
  // Convert back to UTC for storage, but maintain the Argentina-based week calculation
  const mondayUTC = new Date(monday.getTime() - (argentinaOffset * 60 * 1000));
  
  return mondayUTC;
}
```

### Key Improvements
1. **Argentina Timezone Awareness**: All calculations now use Argentina timezone (UTC-3)
2. **Consistent Week Boundaries**: Monday 00:00 ART to Sunday 23:59 ART
3. **UTC Storage Compatibility**: Results are converted back to UTC for database storage
4. **Server Independence**: Works regardless of server's local timezone

## Testing Results

### Test 1: Critical Edge Cases
‚úÖ **Sunday 23:30 Argentina**: Correctly assigned to week ending that Sunday  
‚úÖ **Monday 00:30 Argentina**: Correctly assigned to new week starting that Monday  
‚úÖ **Week Transitions**: Proper boundary handling at midnight Argentina time

### Test 2: Database Compatibility
‚úÖ **Date Serialization**: All dates serialize correctly to ISO strings  
‚úÖ **Storage Format**: Compatible with existing database schema  
‚úÖ **API Integration**: Works seamlessly with `/api/weekly-reports` endpoint

### Test 3: Validation Checks
‚úÖ **Week Structure**: Weeks start on Monday and end on Sunday (Argentina time)  
‚úÖ **Week Duration**: Exactly 7 days (6.999... due to millisecond precision)  
‚úÖ **Timezone Consistency**: All boundaries respect Argentina timezone

### Test 4: Historical Compatibility
‚úÖ **Existing Data**: No impact on previously corrected historical data  
‚úÖ **Future Submissions**: All new reports will use correct week boundaries  
‚úÖ **JSON Export**: File generation system maintains compatibility

## Verification Scenarios

| Scenario | Argentina Time | Expected Week Assignment | Result |
|----------|---------------|-------------------------|---------|
| Sunday 21:00 | domingo, 17/08/2025, 21:00 | Week ending that Sunday | ‚úÖ Correct |
| Sunday 23:30 | domingo, 17/08/2025, 23:30 | Week ending that Sunday | ‚úÖ Correct |
| Sunday 23:59 | domingo, 17/08/2025, 23:59 | Week ending that Sunday | ‚úÖ Correct |
| Monday 00:01 | lunes, 18/08/2025, 00:01 | New week starting | ‚úÖ Correct |
| Monday 02:00 | lunes, 18/08/2025, 02:00 | New week starting | ‚úÖ Correct |
