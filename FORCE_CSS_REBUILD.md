# FORCE CSS REBUILD - Production Fix

**Timestamp**: 2025-08-14T23:05:00Z
**Issue**: Production serving uncompiled Tailwind CSS source instead of compiled CSS
**Build ID**: Force rebuild to generate new CSS hash

## Problem Analysis

Production is serving CSS file `ffce332b61cd1844.css` which contains:
```css
@tailwind base;@tailwind components;@tailwind utilities;
```

This is the RAW Tailwind source, not the compiled output. The local build generates `3d449161ed79ec1a.css` with properly compiled Tailwind classes.

## Solution

This file forces a cache-busting rebuild that will:
1. Generate new build manifest with fresh CSS hash
2. Force Vercel to recompile all CSS assets
3. Ensure Mac-style UI classes are properly compiled
4. Clear any cached uncompiled CSS files

## Expected Outcome

Production should serve properly compiled CSS with:
- All Tailwind utility classes
- Mac-style custom CSS classes (.mac-card, .mac-button, etc.)
- Backdrop-filter and glass-morphism effects
- Custom animations and keyframes
