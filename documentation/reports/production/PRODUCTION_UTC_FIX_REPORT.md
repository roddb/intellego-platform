# Production UTC Midnight Cutoff Bug Fix Report

**Date**: August 13, 2025  
**Operation**: Critical UTC Midnight Cutoff Bug Correction  
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED

## Summary

The UTC midnight cutoff bug that was affecting week assignment of student progress reports has been successfully identified and corrected in the production database. This bug was causing Sunday night submissions (Argentina time) to be incorrectly assigned to the following week due to UTC timezone conversion.

## Issue Description

**Problem**: Reports submitted on Sunday nights (Argentina time) were being assigned to Week 3 (Aug 11-17) instead of Week 2 (Aug 4-10) due to UTC midnight cutoff calculation error.

**Root Cause**: When students submitted reports on Sunday night in Argentina (UTC-3), the system was using UTC time for week boundary calculations, causing late Sunday submissions to cross into Monday UTC and be assigned to the wrong week.

**Impact**: 53 student reports were incorrectly assigned, including critical reports from students like Mia Pleitel who were showing in the wrong week in instructor dashboards.

## Corrections Applied

### Pre-Correction State
- **Week 2 (Aug 4-10)**: 118 reports
- **Week 3 (Aug 11-17)**: 59 reports
- **Mia Pleitel**: Both reports incorrectly in Week 3

### Post-Correction State
- **Week 2 (Aug 4-10)**: 171 reports (+53)
- **Week 3 (Aug 11-17)**: 6 reports (-53)
- **Mia Pleitel**: Both reports correctly moved to Week 2

### Specific Corrections
**Moved 53 reports** from Week 3 to Week 2, including:
- Mia Pleitel (EST-2025-031): Física & Química reports
- 51 other student reports submitted on Sunday, August 10, 2025

## Safety Measures

1. **Complete Backup**: Created `production-utc-backup-2025-08-13.json` with 177 reports before any changes
2. **Transaction Safety**: Applied corrections using individual UPDATE statements with verification
3. **Rollback Capability**: Backup allows complete restoration if needed
4. **Verification**: Multiple validation checks confirmed successful corrections

## Verification Results

✅ **All Sunday submissions correctly moved from Week 3 to Week 2**  
✅ **Mia Pleitel's reports now show in correct week (Week 2)**  
✅ **No data loss or corruption**  
✅ **Week 3 now only contains legitimate Monday+ submissions**  
✅ **Production database now matches corrected local state**

## Technical Details

### Database Changes
```sql
-- Applied to 53 reports
UPDATE ProgressReport 
SET weekStart = '2025-08-04T00:00:00.000Z',
    weekEnd = '2025-08-10T23:59:59.999Z'
WHERE id IN (affected_sunday_submissions)
```

### Students Affected
- **Total Students**: 32 unique students
- **Total Reports**: 53 reports (Física and Química subjects)
- **Submission Pattern**: All submitted on Sunday, August 10, 2025 (Argentina time)
- **Time Range**: 6:05 PM to 9:29 PM (Argentina time)

## Files Created

1. **`production-utc-backup-2025-08-13.json`** - Complete backup before corrections
2. **`analyze-production-utc-bug.js`** - Analysis script
3. **`backup-and-fix-production-utc.js`** - Correction script  
4. **`verify-production-fix.js`** - Verification script
5. **`PRODUCTION_UTC_FIX_REPORT.md`** - This report

## Database Consistency Status

✅ **Local Database**: UTC bug previously fixed  
✅ **Production Database**: UTC bug now fixed  
✅ **Synchronization**: Both databases now consistent  
✅ **User Experience**: Students and instructors now see correct week assignments

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor**: Watch for any similar timezone-related issues in future weeks
2. **Prevention**: Consider implementing timezone-aware week calculation logic
3. **Documentation**: Update development guidelines to prevent similar issues
4. **Testing**: Add timezone edge case tests for week boundary calculations

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fix
- Students confused about week assignments
- Instructors seeing incorrect progress tracking
- Data inconsistency between expected and actual weeks
- Mia Pleitel specifically affected (example case)

### After Fix
- All reports now in correct weeks
- Instructor dashboards show accurate student progress
- Student submissions properly organized by submission week
- Complete data consistency achieved
