# CRITICAL TIMEZONE FIX - IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED

## Issue Analysis Complete
- **Root Cause**: `canSubmitForSubject()` uses UTC time (`new Date()`) vs Argentina time for validation
- **Current Time**: Aug 17, 2025 9:58 PM Argentina (still within Semana 3 submission window)
- **Impact**: Students cannot submit reports due to timezone mismatch

## Exact Fix Required

### File: `/src/lib/db-operations.ts`

#### 1. Update Import Statement
**Current**:
```typescript
import { getWeekBoundaries } from './timezone-utils';
```

**Fixed**:
```typescript
import { getWeekBoundaries, getCurrentArgentinaDate } from './timezone-utils';
```

#### 2. Replace UTC Date with Argentina Date
**Current (Line ~306)**:
```typescript
const currentDate = new Date();
```

**Fixed**:
```typescript
const currentDate = getCurrentArgentinaDate();
```

## Deployment Instructions
1. Apply the two changes above to `/src/lib/db-operations.ts`
2. Test locally to confirm fix works
3. Commit and push immediately for auto-deployment
4. Verify production functionality

## Expected Result
- Students will be able to submit reports for current week (Semana 3)
- Timezone consistency between calendar display and submission validation
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Critical Priority
This fix must be deployed IMMEDIATELY as students are currently blocked from submitting their weekly reports.
